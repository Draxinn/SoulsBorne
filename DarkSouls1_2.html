<p>Dark Souls was second in line, created in 2011. It surpassed its predecessor Demon's Souls in popularity, and is usually credited with bringing attention to the series. New areas, new NPCs, and over all, new game mechanics. The most noticeable changes from Demon's Souls were: the game no longer changes difficulty to suit you but has certain challenges to overcome one at a time, there is another spirit type that can invade you and turn normal enemies into monsterous nightmares known as Black Phantoms, and a new anti-stun statistic called poise, which, with the right armor, could make you almost unstoppable. Dark Souls had one DLC and was later re-released under the title "Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition. The DLC added a fair amount of new content, expanding on the story and "lore" of the game. Dark Souls is my personal favorite, as it is mildly challenging for players new to the series, and includes several lovable characters to meet, primarily being:</p>

<p>Next up is Dark Souls 2, released originally in 2014. Unfortunately, it was directed by a different person than the last two games. Due to this, when compared to Dark Souls, it almost isn't the same game other than the title and some weapons and spells. The game overall took on a cartoonish style and more enemies were placed to slow down people trying to speed through the game. Even when the game was remade for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, many of the problems still remained, and more arose. With the arrival of the three DLCs, the game was heavily strained, and through all the updates and fixes, the servers to this day still have problems with connection speeds and hackers.</p>

<p>Some crazy manipulation of the game was possible, this being probably the most common of them all.</p>
