<p>This started with a game created in 2008 by FromSoftware, named "Demons Souls." Demons Souls was the first of it's kind: an open-world RPG that had no pause function, and allowed other people to enter your session as "spirits." These spirits had two types: Dark spirits and Phantoms. Dark Spirits join your world against your will and have one objective: killing you. Phantoms join your world via "summoning" them, and they are there to help you progress through the game. As the game cannot be paused, any world events that are happening will continue to do so until you quit the game. Also, the game actively changes difficulty level to match your skill. If you die a lot, the game becomes easier, and vice-versa. The game as a whole was considered exceptionally difficult by many who played it, and thus the SoulsBorne reputation began.</p>
