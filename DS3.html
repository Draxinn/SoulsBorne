<p>Dark Souls 3 is the easiest and most likely the best choice for newcomers. Released in 2016, it is basically the love letter to the community. It is filled to the brim with lore from all previous games. There are characters with names relating to older items and vice-versa, other characters that are almost copies of former games, and returns to its roots with structures and names from Dark Souls scattered evenly throughout. There is a nest hidden in all three Dark Souls games, as well as Demon's Souls. This nest acts as a way to trade items you might have extras of for other items that are only obtainable this way. Dark Souls 3 has 2 DLCs, and are almost direct references to Dark Souls. The first one is based off a secret area in Dark Souls, and the second is a culmination of the game series' obsession with fire and the "Curse of the Darksign." The Darksign is what continues to revive your character after death.</p>
